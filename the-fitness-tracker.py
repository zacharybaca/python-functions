"""Task 1: Develop a function to log different fitness activities and their duration. For instance, activities = [’Dancing’, ‘Swimming’, ‘Biking’] and duration = [10, 20, 15] where Dancing corresponds to 10 minutes, Swimming corresponds to 20 minutes, and Biking corresponds to 15 minutes.

Task 2: Write a simple function that estimates calories burned based on the activity and duration. For instance, Total calories burned = Duration (in minutes)*3.5

Task 3: Create a summary function that provides a report of all activities and total calories burned for the day."""
